<span class="dropcap">D</span>escending from the Mt. Baker trailhead, I turned my
phone on with reluctance. Four days without signal guaranteed a
cacophony of alerts once connectivity was restored. As
the week's clutter scrolled across the screen, one message stood out:


<blockquote class="pullquote">
    <p class="quote">
        Clear Saturday! Snow Creek Wall?
    </p>
</blockquote>

 We'd been hankering to climb *Outer Space* (III, 5.9) in Leavenworth for
months, but the weather had been uncooperative. Gorgeous, sun-drenched weeks
were repeatedly tainted by weekend downpours. Despite the fatigue from Baker,
Peter's notice of a weather window was too much to resist. Stopping at home
just long enough to swap crampons for climbing shoes, I left for
Leavenworth, rack in hand and visions of pristine alpine granite in mind.

Arriving past midnight, I scored a fitful night's sleep at the Snow Creek
Trailhead. At dawn, we set off for the Wall. An hour's approach to the
climbers' trail, a spate of log crossings, and a few routefinding mishaps
brought us to the base of our objective.

We racked up and hung our packs before pulling out the topo, giddy with
anticipation of the climb to come. For Peter, it was an opportunity to work
the penultimate pitch once again; a fingerlock right off the anchor had given
him trouble during past attempts. For me, a new trad climber, an area
mega-classic featuring one of Washington's longest hand cracks, some
impressively exposed traverses, and great gear seemed the perfect
way to spend a Saturday.

Inspecting the route, we agreed to avoid the 5.- scramble to Two Tree Ledge
and try the start recommended in the Herrington guidebook. At 09:25, we
began on *Remorse*. When we arrived at the car thirteen hours later, our
hearts were full of it.

#### P1/5.0: Stoke High

Eager to warm up and a good deal more confident in his routefinding abilities,
Peter volunteered to lead the first pitch. Practically a scramble, we spent a
good deal of time working out which shrub marked the belay ledge. Attempts to
gain one we had scoped out from the base required far harder climbing than
expected of the pitch's 5.- grade. Eventually, Peter relented and downclimbed
several meters to build an anchor and bring me up.

*n.b.* it's possible to combine this pitch with the
next if you're not opposed to simulclimbing. Due to our difficulty
determining the midway point we didn't perform the P2 link
up, but would recommended it.

#### P2/5.8: Pitch, Please

My first 5.8 trad lead, it was also where the realisation I'd
developed a masochistic appreciation for slab climbing struck. Described in *Cascades
Rock* as a "thin, technical traverse", it meanders across the face of Snow
Creek Wall towards a comfortable belay a dozen meters below Two Tree Ledge.

The crux involves a ~3m wide flake perched above a
nearly featureless slab. Daunting at first, the stellar rock
quality and fixed cams render it rather less intimidating.
Thorough inspection revealed several positive divots, and the flake had ample room
for hands. A careful step through saw me past and on to several
meters of low fifth climbing before the belay.

Delighted by my onsight, I began bringing Peter across. As I belayed, I
reached into my pack for water, noticing I'd only half a liter remaining. As
we were making decent time, I thought little of it &mdash; we'd be back at the
car by mid-afternoon at the latest.

#### P3/5.7: No Chim Chimney For Me

Sensing my elation, Peter graciously let me continue leading. The pitch offers
the choice between a slabby face and a thin crack for pro, or a chimney that
gradually transitions into offwidth. I needn't clarify which I climbed.

A great pitch for a new leader, with ample opportunity for protection, it was
a fun but otherwise unremarkable portion of our day.

#### P4/5.9: Dehydration Station

<span class="dropcap">H</span>aving gained Two Tree Ledge and put *Remorse*
behind us, we were on route and eager to start one of the climb's best
pitches. However, a party that began just after we'd completed P1 was at our
heels, and we agreed to let them pass. That decision would haunt us, turning
the day from a leisurely Grade III climb into a fifteen hour ordeal.

The sun beat upon us as we waited for them to finish the pitch, *Outer
Space*'s crux. Though they were quick off the belay, a flurry of takes had
soon followed. My supply of water was dwindling, and there was no shade to be
found. We lingered on the ledge, our wait as interminable as the rope drag of
a 5.6 Beckey traverse. By the time our climb resumed, fatigue and severe
headache had set in. Not wanting to force a retreat and disappoint my partner,
I pressed on without comment.

Peter ambled way up to the famed airy traverse and, with some swearing and
smearing, made it through. From there, the ascent slowed. I distinctly recall
checking my watch and, at times, wondering whether he'd wandered off route.
His much belated (and long awaited) bellow of "NICK, OFF BELAY!" became the
highlight of my day.

Pulling onto the face, the reality of my declining condition sank in. With a
pounding head and thickening tongue, I was, for once, glad to be a top rope
tough guy. What should have been a cruiser section felt as strenuous as
redpointing a long-term project. I struggled upwards. Flopping onto
the belay ledge, I saw Peter glance worriedly at his watch. It's
mid-afternoon and two pitches, an arduous fourth-class descent, and an
hour's walk separate us from the trailhead.

#### P5/5.7: I Don't Know What To Do With My Hands

After exchanging gear and reflaking the rope to get Peter on top, we continue.
Though I'd been eager to take this lead, a sustained, hand-sized splitter
flanked by chicken-heads, dehydration had rendered me physically and mentally
unfit for it.

With a decade of crack experience and quadruples of #1s and #2s, Peter
floated up the face, and it was soon my turn to follow. Slightly delirious, I
abandoned any semblance of technique and reverted to every boulderer's
favourite strategy: just add power. Fifteen minutes of strained lie-backs,
sketch-y smears, and chicken-head-to-chicken-head dead-points had me back beside
Peter, all without touching the pitch's central feature.

He asks how I'd found the jam near the crux section, and is confounded by my
description of a tech-y lay-back involving knee smears, a small left foot
crystal, and prayer. His wry suggestion that I at least *try* a hand jam goes
unacknowledged. Only a pitch and a half remained, and I'd a singular focus:
removing my climbing shoes ASAP.

#### P6/5.9: Aid Climbing Not Always Aid?

Having lead everything since the third pitch, Peter had tired of free climbing
and chose to aid the boulder-y start off the ledge. Though inwardly I groaned,
knowing I'd have to clean a half dozen weighted pieces, I was grateful for
anything that would hasten upwards progress and relief for my toes.

While I passed back the octuple of hand-sized cams, Peter set to fashioning
makeshift étriers and plugging pro into the finger-crack at our right.
After a few earnest bounce tests and a rote safety check, he gingerly steps
into the aiders. Everything holds; there's a faint sigh of relief. He begins
to ascend, rhythmically shuffling gear upwards, clipping and unclipping,
'til he's just below the transition into a hand-sized crack that
runs the remainder of the pitch.

With a loud bang, the line goes taut. The piece Peter's aider was clipped to
had pulled, dropping him several feet and slamming his head into the wall. He
seems conscious and alert, and &mdash; after a tense moment &mdash; shouts
that he's able to continue. As he glances down, I see a stream of blood run
across his brow. He transitions into the hand-crack and quickly disappears
beyond a bulge; the black streak marking half rope passes through my belay plate, and the
remainder of the the length promptly follows. The cry of "off belay" rains down.
Had there been enough moisture left in my body to salivate, I would have. The
end was near.

My turn to climb. I strip the anchor in record time and bolt towards the crack,
jamming hands and feet with wild abandon. I take full advantage of my top rope
invincibility and power past the fingerlock that had driven Peter to aid. Past
here it feels like easy fifth, and as I come to the bulge, visions of flat
ground and clear mountain springs flash through my mind. Pulling over the top, I
halt. Peter is perched at a gear anchor beneath a giant flake.  Above him,
there's thirty metres of slab. I pad towards the belay and clove in.

#### P7/5.-: I Was Told There'd Be No Runout

"You're up." I stare back blankly. "What?"

"You gotta lead it. I can't do a runout, not now."

It's obvious to us both that the expanse above can't be protected. The easiest
line follows a series of chicken-heads before transitioning into low angle slab.
Aside from a small flake barely three metres from the belay, there won't be a
placement until I reach the gravel-strewn top of Snow Creek Wall and sling a
boulder.

"OK," I concede. Though my heart's not in it, I can hardly deny his request.

Cleaning had left me with most of the rack, and so I set off without
exchanging gear to expedite our descent. Reaching the first flake, I sigh.
There's barely a hairsbreadth between it and the wall. I slot in a 00 &mdash;
totally bomber &mdash; clip a double, and continue upwards. Occasionally, I
reassure myself that everything will be fine by repeating the mantra "Just
don't fall." I'd read this works for Alex Honnold; we must be wired
differently.

Half-crawling, I reach the top of the wall, beeline for a tree a dozen meters
away, build an anchor, and bring Peter up. There's an immediate sense of
relief as he reaches me, but we're not home yet. It's a quarter past seven,
and we've only two hours until nightfall. We tend to
Peter's wound and take a few moments to collect ourselves before
the descent.

#### What Goes Up…

Per usual, the descent beta was patronisingly vague. "Scramble gullies at left".
Roughly three-quarters of the way down, after a few scrapes and scree-induced
slides, we gave up our cairn hunting and began traversing skiier's left,
perpendicular to the slope. We popped out of some brush 30' above a clear trail
leading back to our suspended bags. Peter chose to backtrack and find a less
exposed route while I attempted to downclimb. A few tenuous fourth-class moves
reunited me with our packs and stash of water; I drank an entire liter without
pausing for air.

Several other parties were also packing up, and we were grateful for the company
on the hike back out to the Enchantments trail. From there, we split up - they
were significantly less tired and soon disappeared into the distance. We pulled
out our headlamps and tramped back to the trailhead in silence, finally reaching
it around quarter past ten. Sweaty, tired, and famished, we're also victorious.

As we pulled away, I had only one question for Peter: "Still game for Prusik in
a day?"
