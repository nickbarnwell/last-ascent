<span class="dropcap">H</span>aving gotten lost on SEWS Friday, I was determined
not to let the weekend pass without topping out at another multi-pitch route.
Still a touch shaken from [Yak Peak](/log/2016/08/01/yak-shaving), I jumped at
(another) Nick's invitation to join him for Darrington's Three O'Clock Rock classic,
*Silent Running* (5.9+, II). Nothing like six pitches of hands-free,
calf-burning ~~crawling~~ climbing to conquer a *slight* slab-phobia!
