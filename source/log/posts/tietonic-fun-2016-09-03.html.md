<span class="dropcap">T</span>ook a hiatus from aggravating my patellar
tendonitis and my physical therapist over Labour Day weekend and headed to
Tieton for some trad climbing with Peter. 

We'd done Sahale together earlier this year and had a great time, but wanted
to crag together before attempting high commitment alpine routes later
this season (Weather Gods permitting üôè). Though our sport and bouldering grades
are a ways apart, throw us both on hand crack and you'd pick him as the stronger
climber every time!

Illness forced an early return on day two, but we managed to lead a nice
variety of routes before then.

* *Unfit* (5.6): Flaring portions are all wide hands or worse for me. Mantle at
  the end is the sort of "fun" that got me hooked on trad.  
* *Wild Beast* (5.7): One of my favourite climbs at Tieton. Wide section spices
  up an otherwise unremarkable hand crack.
* *People, Places, and Things* (5.8): Redpointed this on my my last trip to the
  area but ended up having to take after psyching myself out 20' above my last
  piece. Finally recognised waiting 'til you're scared might not be the best
  strategy for placing pro...
* *Eat a Peach* (5.7): Peter shot up this one so we could try TR'ing the next
  route on the list. Splitter hand and fists, way more fun than Royal Column's
  sandbagged *Mushmaker* (5.7+).
* *Living for the City* (5.10c): I'd previously been under the impression finger
  crack meant ringlock size and smaller and been keen to avoid it. This line set
  me straight! Fingerlocking felt far more natural than hand jamming, and I'm
  now stoked to try harder trad routes having onsightied this.
* *Alar* (5.8): Skipped this on the last few trips due to the bush that's
  sprouted on the first quarter of the climb. Decided to give it a go as we were
  standing under it at the end of the day. A touch harder harder than
  Vantage's *Party In Your Pants*, since the left crack is well into offwidth territory
  and difficult to protect.

All in all, a fun weekend and a nice respite for my knees.
