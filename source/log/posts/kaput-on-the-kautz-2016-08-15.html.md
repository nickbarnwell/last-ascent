<span class="dropcap">T</span>he Kautz was the perfect objective to end my
first season of mountaineering. Though neither as remarkable a wildnerness
experience as Tahoma Glacier nor as technically challenging as Ptarmigan Ridge,
its two ice pitches and steep snow still ward off the hordes that ascend
Rainier's most popular routes, the Emmons and Disappointment Cleaver. 

Once an equally crazy partner was convinced to join me, planning commenced in
earnest. Mid-August promised good weather and better climbing -- TRs from the
end of July indicated the Kautz chute was still snow-laden and didn't have much
in the way of ice, and those pitches were half my motivation for climbing the
route. Prayers for good temps were met in a manner befitting Grecian tragedy:
the car's thermometer read 84Âº as we rolled into the Paradise parking lot.

We ambled into the CIC around nine for permits and last minute beta. The
climbing ranger on duty had been in the 7/24 party and encouraged us to approach
from Comet Falls rather than attempt navigating the crevassed mess of the lower
Nisqually. Scenic compared to the traverse across the featureless lower slopes
of the mountain, it would also add some 3,000' of gain to our approach. How fun!

#### Upwards and Onwards

Departing from the trailhead circa 10:30, we made excellent time on the
well-maintained trails to Van Trump Park. Dipping our buffs in the streams along
the way granted a welcome, if temporary, respite from the heat. We stopped at
the Comet Falls vista to enjoy the shade, adjust packs, and break into the first
of many Clif Bars before resuming our breakneck ascent.

Our pace slowed slightly as we broke out of the trees and onto
the climbers' trail that beelines for the Wapowety Cleaver. A copse of trees at
6,700' provided the last shade we'd find until well past Muir.
Snow slogging ensued.

We encountered running water several hundred feet off route to climber's right
at 7,500'. As we stopped to lunch and refill our bottles, I noticed I'd set a
personal record: we'd covered the first 3,900' in just under three hours at what
felt like a leisurely pace. Trading time at the climbing gym for conditioning
hikes *was* worthwhile after all. Past the tarn, the snow began to steepen; we
soon traded kicking steps into suncups for ever-lengthening traverses of the
snowfield. Following a goat track along the slopes, crampons went on the base of
the aptly named Turtle.

Wary of icefall at Camp Hazard and not keen on hiking farther, we chose to
camp ~1,000' feet below the rappel to the Kautz. A hint of bootpack traversing
onto rock at 10,450' clued us into a potential bivy spot. An unrewarding and
sphincter-clenching scramble through the Rainier's famed choss yielded a
well-protected outcrop with phenomenal views of Hood, Adams, and St. Helens. We
set up our shelters, devoured our dinners, and melted snow in preparation for
the morn's climb.

Fatigued from the lengthy approach and with a dearth of ice climbing experience --
this would actually be my first time swinging a tool -- we opted for a late
start. We thought the extra rest and extra light would serve us well on
the Kautz Chute. It was a regrettable decision.

#### Hero Ice
 
![](log/posts/kaput-on-the-kautz-2016-08-15/astro-sunrise.jpg)

Our belated start gave ample time to toy with my camera and enjoy
the glacial landscape. Though I prefer the views of the North Cascades to
Rainier's vistas, the flat landscape that grants the latter its prominence may
be appreciated in its own right. By time I was satisfied with my shutter speed
setting and Jon had overpowered his bivy bag's stuff sack, it was nearly half
past three. 

Not wanting to expose our hands to the morning chill and fiddle with crampons,
we stayed on rock for the jaunt to Camp Hazard. Apart from one bulge of snow
below the Castle that called for step cutting, it was an uneventful start to the
morning. We passed another party still asleep in their tent at 11,000' and
tip-toed by to reach the rappel down to the Kautz.

A fixed line was present but in poor condition, and we chose to descend on our
own rope. Awaiting dawn's first rays and in no rush to reach the glacier, we
idled at the cliff's edge for some time, enjoying the soothing sounds of distant
icefall. By six we'd rapped down, traversed to the foot of the first pitch, and
roped up. Jon gave me a brief ice climbing tutorial --- pointy bits go forward,
don't drop anything, avoid falling dinner plates --- and set off up the slope. 
We climbed two pitches of twenty-five to forty-five degree ice with some *slightly*
steeper bulges (AI2 at most); the backsides of penitentes dotting the face provided ample rest
for our calves. Realising we'd lost time sewing up the first pitch, we
simulclimbed to the next belayed section.

![](log/posts/kaput-on-the-kautz-2016-08-15/kautz-chute.jpg)

While it appeared steep and foreboding from afar, the second pitch was, if
anything, easier than the first. The sun's rays warmed the upper step, lending ice
the texture of alpinists' dreams: every swing produced an
anchor-worthy placement. This was the reason we'd come to Rainier in August! The
ice was so confidence inspiring that only a single screw was placed. I can
scarcely imagine a better introduction to alpine ice, and eagerly anticipate
being scared and disappointed in worse conditions on harder routes this winter.
The headwall separating the top of the pitch from the upper Kautz Glacier was
easily simulclimbed.

#### Down And Out On The Upper Kautz

As we angled north, toward Rainier's summit crater, our fortune turned south.
Roping up for glacier travel, Jon discovered that he'd left his sunglasses at
camp. For lack of an alternative, my buff was repurposed as a
Daredevil-esque eye covering; the irony of blinding as defense against blindness
went unappreciated. With Jon unable to see, I would be solely responsible
for setting the pace, kicking steps, and navigating the numerous crevasses on
the way to Columbia Crest.

Leading out towards the Wapowety Cleaver, I began to worry that Jon's vision may
not be the only complication. He'd seemed a bit disoriented earlier that
morning, but I'd chalked it up to caffeine deprivation. Now, he was asking to
rest and catch his breath after only a few hundred feet of walking. I realise
altitude, not a missed cuppa, is the cause of his distress. Stopping to rest
didn't seem to help, so we adopt a turtle's pace to keep progressing. It took
two hours to travel from the headwall to the tip of the cleaver, a mere 900'.

By half noon -- five hours past sunrise -- we had yet to locate a bridge to the
Nisqually Glacier. Its gentle slopes lie on the far side of a a gaping crevasse,
nearly one hundred feet across at the widest point. The best line we could
identify, the dilapidated remains of a solid early season crossing, called for
15' of downclimbing to a pillar, stemming to another detached chunk of ice, and
climbing out again. Though it looks like it'd go, I was unconvinced Jon could
execute a rescue should I fall. There was no alternative to the risky platforms
in sight, and so I turned us back towards Point Success.

It was now 12:15, and 1,200' of rapidly softening snow lay between us and the
summit. In different circumstances, this is the point where I would have
abandoned a summit attempt. As it was, I worried that Jon's AMS symptoms would
only worsen with time at elevation. Getting us down ASAP was the goal, and while
bivying until nightfall firmed things up would be ideal, we didn't have the
luxury of waiting. When I brought up the subject of retreating down the chute,
he said he was uncomfortable rappelling in his condition. With descent out of
the picture, getting down meant going up. I set to plotting our course.

![](log/posts/kaput-on-the-kautz-2016-08-15/upper-kautz.jpg)

From our vantage, there seemed a path that would traverse diagonally left, avoiding
seracs and bridging the crevasse dividing the glacier, eventually breaking west
towards the crater rim. It would be a steep, strenuous line, and there was
risk of being stymied on the upper half of the glacier by an impassable crack
invisible from below. Eager to keep moving, we took our chances.

#### V.iii.3085-86

For the first 500' my spirits rose - had our luck returned? Despite steeper
terrain, the pace increased as we wove through the penitentes, and the snow was
reassuringly firm. The first of two bridge crossings further reinforced my
confidence. Soft at the edges, it held up when probed and bore our weight
without complaint. I even began to allow myself the hope of making it down in
time to hitchhike back to Comet Falls. Misfortune resumed.

At the lip of what we hoped to be the final gaper on our ascent, we faced a
dilemma: cross a lengthy bridge of questionable strength or a short bridge
clearly in poor condition. Such luck ðŸ‘µ! With a visual assessment proving
insufficient, I went to probe the bridges while Jon readied a belay. I watched
his picket sink to the hilt with a single tap; not a good sign.

"On belay?"

"Belay's on!"

I inched towards the lower of the two bridges. Two feet from the edge, my left
leg punched through to the ankle. Turning uphill to extricate myself, the rest
of my leg followed. This was not the crossing we were looking for. I headed back
towards Jon and the other bridge. If this didn't hold, we'd be stuck on the
glacier, a scenario we neither packed for nor desired. Gingerly, I stepped
towards the lip. It held. A bit farther and I managed a solid-feeling stick with
my tool on the far side. I'm across. 

Worried I may still be perched over the crevasse's maw, I proceeded forward 'til
the ground seemed firmer and prepared to belay Jon. He crossed without incident,
and again, for just a moment, our moods lightened. Half a rope length from the
bridge, I found myself sitting au cheval, legs swinging freely beneath
me. I was suspended by my pack and a crampon point that dug in as I fell. Jon
leapt to self-arrest, but his tools were useless in the slush, ripping through
without catching. Miraculously, I managed to sink the spike of my axe into a
form patch on the far side and, with my best beached whale impression, crawl
out.

I'd slipped into a narrow, ski track style crevasse running parallel to the
slope. In direct light, it had been difficult to differentiate it from the
surrounding snow. Standing to either side, our shadows rendered the small
depression readily apparent, and we noticed a half dozen similar areas uphill.
Falstaff's famous line echoed in my head. Unwilling to take another fall, I
motioned to retreat. Debate ensued.

"It's only a little farther, we can make it!"

"I don't want to risk it. We can barely arrest, and it gets steeper
from here."

The back and forth continued for several minutes before Jon relented, accepting
it was too late in the day to safely continue. Return to the cleaver was
nerve-wracking; shaken by my fall, I leapt to the far side of the bridge we'd so
cautiously crossed on the way up. The rest of the shlep down the hillside is
blessedly mundane. On rock again, we unroped and made camp.

#### Cowboy Camp

We estimated the snow would be sufficiently firm again by midnight and agree on a
1:00AM start. Planning done, we settled in for the long wait.

![](log/posts/kaput-on-the-kautz-2016-08-15/bivy-two.jpg)

While Jon enjoyed a nap, I took inventory of food and fuel. Having planned to be
back at Paradise by mid-afternoon, I packed lightly for summit day: a few ounces
of nuts and three Clif Bars remained. Fortunately, fuel was plentiful -- we'd
enough for another two days of water without rationing.

Still too on edge to sleep, I passed the time by pacing, melting snow, and
practicing a few infrequently-used knots. Jon woke after a few hours and joined
me on the ridgeline. Excitedly, he begins pointing and waving towards the lower
glacier. The party we'd passed early that morning was making their way towards
us. Nearer to the cleaver, they shout to ask why'd we'd retreated. Describing
the poor conditions, we entreat them to join us for the remainder of the
climb. They graciously accept the invitation. We make a round of introductions
and explain the details of our plan, as well as how we'd gotten stuck. 

I woke around 10PM to stretch my legs and check the snow conditions. Perfectly
firm! Thrilled, I melt a few more liters of water and enjoy a celebratory handful
of nuts, then curl back up in my sleeping bag for some stargazing. With the stroke
of midnight, I packed up and woke the rest of the team. 

#### High Pressure Ridge

Retracing my steps up the Kautz Glacier for the third time, I was grateful for
Brian and Dylan's company and the extra safety of having them along. Though we
were all tired and hungry, everyone was grateful to be moving after hours of
idling on the Wapowety. We made good time to the foot of the bridge that had
given me such a fright.

With the line taut, I prodded and probed the way across, moving more confidently
with each step. Having enjoyed several hours of respite from the sun's rays, it
was once again frozen solid, and the rest of the team was able to follow across
without hesitation or additional protection. Glad to have one obstacle behind
us, we resumed zig-zagging across the slope, mindful of cracks like the one I'd
fallen into. We found a handful through probing and likely crossed half a dozen
smaller examples without noticing. Navigation will be complicated once those
open up.

Around 13,800', we abandon traversing and dig in with our front points, climbing
the final three hundred feet towards Point Success with Teutonic determination.
The slope steepened considerably, and unable to see over top, we prayed there
was no crevasse to impede us. Pulling over the lip, I cried out in elation. The
terrain was flat, the route to Columbia Crest direct, and our path free of
obstacles.

![We did it](log/posts/kaput-on-the-kautz-2016-08-15/summit.jpg)

We reached the summit around 3AM and had a small celebration; Dylan passed
around a can of Rainier he'd carried for just this occasion. Though thrilled to
have summitted, I was mentally and physically exhausted, freezing, and eager to
get home. Too cold to remove the long johns wrapped around my neck, I even
forewent a summit photo. Enjoying the views of city lights on the horizon for a
few moments longer, we turn towards the summit crater and steel ourselves for
the mind-numbing boredom of descent.

#### Disappointment Indeed

The Disappointment Cleaver lived up to its name. A week after the trip, I'm
still shocked this is Rainier's most popular route. Looking down on the crater
from Columbia Crest, the path could not have been more clear -- bootpack
gouged the center, with handrails three feet high to either side. I've seen
portions of Seattle sidewalk in worse condition! 

Operating on autopilot, we tramped across the crater. The route is heavily
wanded, and every crevasse we come to is bridged by a ladder or handline. We saw
about forty people on the way down, but avoided a logjam in all but one
instance.

Views as the sun rose were breathtaking, and I regret having ignored the
urge to snap a few photos. The seracs and crevasses of the Ingraham and
Emmons are otherworldly in the proper light, particularly against the backdrop
of the Tatoosh range. Little Tahoma was astounding, and I look
forward to an attempt next year.

![](log/posts/kaput-on-the-kautz-2016-08-15/little-t.jpg)

Once at Muir, we informed the rangers that both overdue Kautz parties were safe
and accounted for before collapsing on the rocks for a rest. After an hour's
recuperation, we exchanged contact info and split the teams for the final leg to
Paradise. Though Brian and Dylan blitzed down the Muir snowfield and were soon
out of sight, they were rerouted by construction near Paradise, and we ended up
meeting again at the CIC. 

After turning in permits, we made a few short calls to
let our families know we were safe, then secured transit to Comet Falls. I'd
never been so happy to see my car or remove my mountaineering boots.

Reflecting on our relative fortune and what might've happened had there been
less of it, we drove back to Seattle in silence.

#### Aftermath

During the climb and a few days after, I was convinced it would be coldly remembered
as a [Type III experience](type-3). Friends who inquired about the trip were
brushed off or given a curt description of what went wrong. It was painful,
exhausting, and left me considering mortality more often than I'd have liked.

In spite of that, it was also validation of my ability to lead a party, assess
and respond to risk vis-Ã -vis my comfort level, accommodate an incapacitated
partner, and make the best of a sufferfest. In many regards, from the weather we
enjoyed to my pack catching the crevasse lip, we were simply lucky. In other
aspects, shrewd judgment and proper training stopped a bad situation turning
into an epic.

Though it's not an experience I'd repeat, I appreciate having had it, and expect
a few more Type II tales from Rainier before the 2017 season is through.
Ptarmigan Ridge seems funâ€¦
