      Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No not all of
      them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. A trick is something a whore
      does for money…or candy. … or cocaine. We have unlimited juice? This party is
      going to be off the hook. And THAT'S why you always leave a note. What about
      macaroni – let me finish – salad? Even though so many people in this office
      are begging for it. Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne.

      I coordinate development (and anything else involving 1s and 0s).  My
      focus is making it easy  to contribute to Tea With Strangers, whether
      you're an attendee, a host, a potential contributor, or something else
      entirely. If you have feedback on how we can improve, I'd love to hear it!
      On weekends, you can find me hosting tea times in Seattle (and working on
      TWS in between).
