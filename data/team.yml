      I talk to anyone and everyone in the Tea With Strangers community to learn
      how we can create a smaller and more open world. These conversations feed
      the design of the site, the words in our emails, the stories we tell, the
      systems that drive our community&lsquo;s growth, and all of my existential
      crises.

      I coordinate development (and anything else involving 1s and 0s).  My
      focus is making it easy to contribute to Tea With Strangers, whether
      you&rsquo;re an attendee, host, or potential contributor.  On weekends,
      you can find me hosting tea times in Seattle (and working on TWS in
      between).

      I tweet at Ankit sometimes and sometimes help Nick write
      some code. I don&rsquo;t love tea (I think it&rsquo;s pretty good),
      but I love the idea of tea. Also, you can&rsquo;t spell team
      without tea. I just thought of that.

      I am a senior at Stanford majoring in Computer Science. I grew up in the
      bustling city of Singapore but have since grown fond of laid-back
      Californian life. The pinnacle of human civilization is being able to show
      up to work in T-shirt and sandals. I also enjoy living in the future.
